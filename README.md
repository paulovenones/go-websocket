# go-websocket
## Overview

`go-websocket` is a WebSocket server implemented in Go, leveraging concepts such as goroutines, channels, and a WebSocket hub for broadcasting messages. This server allows real-time communication between clients and is designed for a variety of applications, including chat applications, real-time notifications, and more.

## Features 
- **WebSocket Communication:** `go-websocket` provides WebSocket support, enabling bi-directional, full-duplex communication between clients and the server.
- **Goroutine-Based:** The server efficiently manages multiple client connections using goroutines, ensuring scalability and responsiveness.
- **Message Broadcasting:** Messages sent by one client can be broadcasted to all connected clients, enabling real-time group communication.

## Prerequisites

Before running the `go-websocket` server, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:
- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install): The Go programming language is required to build and run the server.

## Installation

To install and run the `go-websocket` server locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:


```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/go-websocket.git
```

2. Change into the project directory:

```bash
cd go-websocket
```

3. Build the server:
   
```bash
go build
```

4. Run the server:
```bash
./go-websocket
```

The server will start and listen for WebSocket connections on the specified port (default is `8080`).

## Usage

### Connecting to the Server

Clients can connect to the WebSocket server using the WebSocket URL. For example:

```javascript
const ws = new WebSocket("ws://your-server-address:8080/ws");
```

The server will start and listen for WebSocket connections on the specified port (default is `8080`).

## Usage

### Connecting to the Server

Clients can connect to the WebSocket server using the WebSocket URL. For example:

const ws = new WebSocket("ws://your-server-address:8080/ws");

Replace "your-server-address" with the actual address of your go-websocket server.

### Sending and Receiving Messages

Once connected, clients can send and receive WebSocket messages using the WebSocket API. Messages can be broadcasted to all connected clients via the server's broadcasting mechanism.

### Example Applications

You can build various real-time applications using go-websocket, such as:

- Chat Applications
- Real-Time Notifications
- Live Dashboards
- Multiplayer Games

## Configuration

go-websocket can be configured using environment variables or a configuration file. Details on configuration options and how to set them can be found in the Configuration Documentation (docs/configuration.md).
